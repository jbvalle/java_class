## Tools for creating a project

### Build Automation Tools
Build Automation Tools like Makefile/CMake are ccommonly used for C/C++ Projects. However due to the Java Compiler beeing much slower than the gcc compiler and because projects in java tend to organize files as groups of files in firectories, vs C usually tend towards flatter structures, make didn't have much direct support to working with hiearchies of files. Therefore needing more optimized build tools were needed like:
- Ant
- Maven 
- Grade
- etc.

These tools would sum up all the files that were out of date, and compile them in one go, rather than compile them individually, therefore speeding up the build process for the much slower java compiler.
