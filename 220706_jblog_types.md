## Java Types and Operators

## Overview

Java Types are divided into following Categories:


<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan=3>primitive Types</td>
<td colspan=2>boolean Types</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan=2>numeric Types</td>
<td>Integer Typer (byte, char, short, int long)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>floating-point Types (float and double)        
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=3>reference Types</td>

</tbody>
</table>

## Integral Types

### Memory Consumption of int Types

| Int Type | Memory|
| --- | --- |
| byte | 8 Bit |
| char | 16 Bit |
| short | 16 Bit |
| int | 32 Bit |
| long | 64 Bit |

## Char Types

### Representation

Char Types are generally an unsigned integer type with the following possible Representations:
- Code point (ex. char var = '50' | prints 2)
- Unicode escape (ex. char var = '\ul0041' | prints A)
- Printable symbol (Displayed on console) (ex. char var = 'x' | prints x)
